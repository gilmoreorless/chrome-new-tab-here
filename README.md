# Open new tab here

A simple Chrome extension to open a new tab next to the one you’re viewing, via a button or a keyboard shortcut.

By default, Chrome will only open a new tab at the very end of the row of tabs, which isn’t always what you want. This is a quick shortcut to open a new tab to the right of the one you’re currently viewing.

You can either use the button to the right of the address bar, or a configurable keyboard shortcut. The default keyboard shortcut is:

* For Windows & Linux: <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>T</kbd>
* For macOS: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>T</kbd>

You can change this shortcut by going to `chrome://extensions` and clicking the "Keyboard shortcuts" link at the bottom of the page.
